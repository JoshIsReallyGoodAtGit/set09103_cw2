      user clicks on 'New Posts'
      user taken to top of the page
      new posts are displayed to user
      old ones go at the bottom

downloading a post
      use AJAX to take new posts
      use a while loop to display the new posts, printing out data in html template


user clicks on 'Details' on a post
      jQuery creates the modal on the fly and populates it with the content from the respective post
      (see notes on AJAX, need a way to transfer data from post to modal AFTER the data has been sent.)
